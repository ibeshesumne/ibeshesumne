Hi I'm @ibeshesumne
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about coding as it relates to finance and real estate. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R and various packages that make importing datasets easier through things like application program interface. And learning how to use some of the tools currently available to make real estate research easier. 
- 💞️ My skills are limited and so I’m not sure can add value to other's projects but welcome the opportunity to learn from best practices and welcome criticism and advice to improve skills and coding.  
- 📫 I am best reached through email.
